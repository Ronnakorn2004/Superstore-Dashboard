# Superstore-Dashboard
## 📝 Superstore Analytics — Project Story (English Version)
This project is an end-to-end Business Intelligence workflow where I worked through the entire process:
data cleaning → transformation → SQL modeling → analysis → DAX measures → dashboard design in Power BI.
My goal was to simulate the real-world responsibilities of a Data Analyst / BI Analyst and produce a dashboard that communicates clear, actionable business insight.

## 1.) Starting with the Raw Data
**I began with the Superstore Sales dataset — a widely used multi-dimensional retail dataset containing:**
- Order information
- Sales, profit, quantity
- Product categories & sub-categories
- Customer segments
- Shipping details
- Regional/geographical information
- Multiple time-based columns
  
**The raw file had several issues:**
- Dates stored as text
- Missing and inconsistent values
- Mixed data types
- Lack of additional analytical columns (Year, Month, Margin, etc.)
- To clean and transform it effectively, I decided to work in Python (Google Colab).
